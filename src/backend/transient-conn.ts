/**
 * FOR THE VERSION 0 PROTOCOL (ALL OF THIS CAN CHANGE BETWEEN VERSIONS)
 *
 * ### A front-to-back connection message consists of the following, in order:
 *
 * 1. A single byte, interpreted as an unsigned integer, which denotes whether
 * the message is a request (value 0) or a stream operation (value is 1)
 * 2. The rest of the bytes will be interpreted according to the type byte above
 *
 * For a request, there will be:
 *
 * 1. A 4-byte unsigned integer which will be used as the request ID; when the server
 * sends a response down the wire, it will use this ID so the frontend knows which
 * request the response is for. The frontend should increment a counter and use the
 * current value every time it sends a request (commonly referred to as a sequence
 * number).
 * 2. A MessagePack-encoded string which is the request type, e.g., "discussion:create".
 * 3. The rest of the bytes will be interpreted on the server according to the request
 * type. Continuing the earlier example, for a "discussion:create" request, the server
 * would (and this is all hypothetical) interpret the bytes as a MessagePack-encoded
 * object containing fields like the name for the discussion. Regarding backwards
 * compatibility, TODO...
 *
 * For a stream, there will be:
 *
 * 1. A 4-byte unsigned integer which will be used as the stream ID; streams may only be
 * opened by the server and the message will be silently ignored by the server if no stream
 * is open with the provided stream ID.
 * 2. A 1-byte stream status which will be interpreted as a bitset. If none of the status bits
 * are set, the server will silently ignore the message. If the 'data' bit is set, the handler
 * for the stream (on the server) will be given the remaining bytes (described next) as a raw
 * binary payload. If the 'close' bit is set, the server will close the stream; this is not
 * mutually exclusive with the 'data' bit, i.e., a single WebSocket message could pass data to
 * the stream and then close it. The 'error' bit indicates that the payload should be treated
 * as an error (meaning it is irrelevant if the 'data' bit is not set), but it is up to the
 * stream handler to decide what that means (it may just treat every payload identically). The
 * 'error' bit primarily exists for server->client stream messages.
 * 3. The rest of the bytes from the WebSocket message will simply be passed to the stream handler
 * if the 'data' status bit is set (some stream handlers might expect a MessagePack-encoded payload,
 * some might expect raw data say for a file upload, some might expect a mixed structure, and vice
 * versa).
 *
 * ### A back-to-front connection message consists of the following, in order:
 *
 * 1. A single byte, interpreted as an unsigned integer, which denotes whether
 * the message is a reply (value 0) or a stream operation (value is 1)
 * 2. The rest of the bytes will be interpreted according to the type byte above
 *
 * For a reply, there will be:
 *
 * 1. A 4-byte unsigned integer which is the request ID this reply corresponds to.
 * 2. A byte which will be zero for success replies and nonzero for error replies.
 * 3. The rest of the bytes should be interpreted as a standard MessagePack-encoded error
 * format (not described here) if the previous byte is nonzero, or according to the request
 * type the reply is for otherwise.
 *
 * For a stream, there will be:
 *
 * 1. A 4-byte unsigned integer which will be used as the stream ID; if the client does not recognize
 * the stream ID (i.e., a handler is not registered), it should store a buffer of messages for the stream
 * until application-level code does subscribe, at which point the connection-level code can replay the
 * messages in-order. This is because the backend may open a stream corresponding to a request before sending
 * back the reply, and it makes more sense for the client to handle this occurrence than it does for the
 * server to struggle to provide strict guarantees.
 * 2. A 1-byte stream status which will be interpreted as a bitset. If none of the status bits
 * are set, the client should silently ignore the message. If the 'data' bit is set, the handler
 * for the stream (on the client) should be given the remaining bytes (described next) as a raw
 * binary payload. If the 'close' bit is set, the server will close the stream; this is not
 * mutually exclusive with the 'data' bit, i.e., a single WebSocket message could pass data to
 * the stream and then close it. The 'error' bit indicates that the payload should be treated
 * as an error (meaning it is irrelevant if the 'data' bit is not set).
 * 3. The rest of the bytes from the WebSocket message will simply be passed to the stream handler
 * if the 'data' status bit is set (some stream handlers might expect a MessagePack-encoded payload,
 * some might expect raw data say for a file download, some might expect a mixed structure, and vice
 * versa).
